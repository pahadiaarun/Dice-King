# Dice-King

Website link: https://pahadiaarun.github.io/Dice-King/

Simple two player dice game. Once the user opens the website it will ask for players name. Click *OK* to leave blank name, the dice will get thrown randomly, so that player 1 and player 2 both have their own dice values. Dice game will then announce a winner depending on whose dice value was higher.

*Refresh to restart the game.*
